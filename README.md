In this project there are two features, one is the login of a teacher that was made using cucumber with Java, apart the other feature is google search, which was made with cucumber, junit and selenium,
where the system as a user open edge as a browser, go to the google.com page and type in the search bar "github" after this it checks if there is an element with its class name, and according to this it prints if it found it or if it did not find it.
To run these features we create a class "test runner" where we can by means of tags run only one of the features according to the necessity, also a report is created in junit and html.
